The Soups , punjabi dishes served were very tasty and hot , a welcome hot intake in contrast to the cold outside. The rooms are neat, spacious and cool. We could see the snowy white mountain tops and musical sound of the water early morning . Manali is beautiful and added with it if we reserve in Sterling it will be two mangoes in one throw. Please visit to take the experience.\n": "Positive",
                    "\nAlthough under renovation & with no amenties to offer, our stay at White Mist was made memorable beocause of the lavish family room offered to us & also exceptional service by the staff at the hotel. Also, the veg food was delicious.Mr. Gaurav, the manager was a delight to deal with & extremely co operative. Once the place is renovated & ready it would give the other hotles which have pathetic service a real run for its money!!Cheers!!\n": "Positive",
                    "\nAmazing stay & food .Had been to manali with my friends and stayed in white mist for 2 days , it was most memorable trip.This hotel had its own brand and hospitality was too good.Staffs were very helpful and friendly .\n": "Positive",
                    "\nAs a sterling holiday Time share member, we were provided rooms in a different block. The location of the hotel is very good, but rooms are average. Even the heaters provided were of very poor quality. It produced more light than heat. The room was lit as if a halogen lamp was lit. Appartment were provided only with a microwave oven and not gas as per the agreement. Overall it was a average room.\n": "Neutral",

                    "\nBeing a Sterling member, this was a natural choice for me. Keeping aside the reservation woes that I have to go through every time to make a booking, he resort itself is just about average.It is located a little away from the main Manali area which was okay since it kept the place quiet. Half the resort was being renovated. The day we reached, the elevator was not working but started once we had climbed four flights of stairs.There was no Wi-Fi & the members' package excluded breakfast. The room was good & overlooked the mountains. We struggled with the all-weather AC a bit as it did not seem to be warming.The spa amenity was unavailable as it was undergoing renovation. In a nutshell, if I was looking only for a place to sleep, this would do. But if I was looking for an all-round resort, this place would not pass the test.\n": "Neutral",
                    "\nBig and spacious room. Good for Family. We went with our kids and I find that kids enjoyed more in the room because of good space and big beds.

                    "\nFirst impression is the most lasting one, it is said. This truly applies to the Sterling White Mist Resort at Manali which I, my hubby & my 14-year old daughter visited during the Deepavali week of November 2012. We reached on 10th night and found the entire resort lit up with fairy lights. What followed was five days of sheer fun & frolic with various activities which the resort offered. Great accommodation, superb views (especially to see the snow-clad peaks from the dining hall window while having your breakfast & lunch), delicious food but the most praiseworthy was the warm, friendly, courteous, cooperative, honest, ever-smiling and ever-helpful staff, pampering us to the hilt and taking care about our minutest requirements. The word \"NO\" does not appear in their dictionary at all, whether it was the security guard at the entrance, the gardener watering the plants, the housekeeping or kitchen staff, the front desk executives or the Resort Manager himself. This speaks volumes about the level of training imparted to the staff. Deepavali was the most exciting day, as right from \"puja\" in the morning to the games & lighting fire crackers in the evening to the buffet spread at night, everything was so magical that we felt we were transported into another land. The resort's travel desk is a great help even if you do not take any packages from them. White Mist had a nice recreation room, a cosy bar and well-maintained garden & lawns. We occupied a clean duplex room, with partial kitchen and the room was fitted with the best of amenities. Although we couldn't take advantage of the spa, I am sure even that could have been a good experience. Thank you for such a memorable stay and a wonderful experience which we are going to cherish for long time to come. As I have aptly titled, it is truly a \"HOME AWAY FROM HOME!\"\n": "Positive",
                    "\nFirst of all when I reached Manali, I was unable to find this property as there are no sign boards. But once when we reached this property, it was very comfortable stay. Though the rooms need an urgent makeover, the atmosphere here was very good. The staff in this hotel are very helpful. they have a perfect traveldesk managed by Nishant. They took care of all our sight seeing needs.Even their restaurant is managed by good staff especially Roshan. He can guide you to whatever you like and will go out of the way to help you. we celebrated my wife's birthday at this hotel, I was unable to get a cake and Roshan was there to help us out. We had a wonderfull time. My 2 daughters enjoyed their vacation a lot. They are again planning to go to Manali in next vacation.Thank You Team White Mist. You made our vacations a wonderful time.\n": "Positive",

                    "\nGot a chance to stay at this Resort .Nice Resort. Location is good. Market just 15 min away from hotel. Very professional staff in all Manali.Superb restaurant & lobby. Food is awesome (but quite expensive). Special thanks to Mr. Hemant (F& B). Very humble and helpful. Overall stay was nice & very silent place. Highly recommended for Honeymooners.\n": "Positive",
                    "\nGreat resort...well renovated...they arranged for the local travel and other facilities within no time...had fun activities arranged...nice in house food but a bit expensive....the choice is completely yours if you want to have food from the resort or from the local dhaba just outside the resort...although i should mention that the food served in the resort was great...nice view(take a room facing the cliffs)...they tend to take some fees for early check in but not much....the travel desk helps you a lot to plan the various sightseeing activities....there are inhouse games like pool table table tennis,chess,and other board games and also the motion sensing video games...I can go on and on with the review but in short a great experience and will definitely return here....\n": "Positive",
                    "\nHave the sterling timeshare and get 6 nights at this resort every year. The place is evolving and improving the services. The rooms are outdated but the restaurant has been done up quite well. Service has improved and unlike last time the garden is maintained well. Nice to see the resort taking initiatives like organizing the evening snacks pary for the inhouse guests, see a merchandize store which has opened up (though they didnot have anything of our interest). Took the food package it was a great deal. The garden is maintained well. This is sbit off from the main city and going to city sometimes is a problem unless you are fine doing haggling with the autos\n": "Positive",
                    "\nHi all - This is Sachin from BHEL - I stayed in Resort in Oct 2014, Resort is good one part is the under renovation and one block is operating. only concern was Resort Policy - when i called up Resort they said pets are not allowed and i made a spl. arrangement for my pet at Delhi itself. This is the first time i was travelling without my Tiger ( pet) .It was surprising to me that when i was their in the Resort i saw security guard was taking one dog to inside the Resort. When i asked him who is this he said Ye GM Sahab Ka Hai. Also mentioned this dog stay in hotel only last 1 year .My Concern is that if your GM can keep pets than why not us. i was ready to pay some nominal charges but mr. Aditya Refused completely - Its not allowed and Pets are not allowed. I think this is not fair.\n": "Positive",
                    "\nHi,I have a special corner for this resort in my heart and It was my first visit after my marriage. The resort is located little far from Mall road.The property is big with different room as per your requirement. I visited in winter so they provided us with Heaters.. The rooms were really cozy and service was excellent.. On Food part.. I must say we stuck to their menu during entire trip and made a point not to eat outside... In the basement, you have the indoor games and disc.. No swimming Pool.. The place was really calm as it is on the outskirts...For Manali outing, They have the customised tour plan as per your need...I had a great experience there as we saw one of the heaviest snowfall of 4 days and explored the resort.\n": "Positive",

                    "\nI booked Sterling Manali through cleartrip. There was an offer going on where i got 40% off on 4 day stay. The total outlay was 13140 for 4 days including breakfast in Junior Suite. The resort is around 3 KM from bus stop. Taxi follows union rates of 150 Rs and auto charges 50 INR. It's one of the few branded resorts in Manali and hence reaching there is not a problem at all. The resort is built on a considerable free space and has two separate buildings - one for restaurant, reception, entertainment area; another for dwelling. There is an open lawn and a small garden. Suites are cozy and has a dry kitchen (coffe maker, microwave and fridge along with basic utensils). The TV is basic and has a Tata Sky connection. Bath room is clean and well maintained with good supply of linen rolls. Room service is prompt and staff always greets with smiling face. The best part is the restaurant. With large glass windows, wooden furnitures and high roof, it's look is distinctly colonial.The breakfast has south indian, continental and north indian menu and i found the preparations fresh and tasty. The non-veg items looked to be expensive and did not have any trout fish dishes. Through those large windows I could clearly see the manali peaks while having food. I did not avail adventure tours (rafting, biking, para gliding, treks) or evening programs conducted by Sterling. Overall it was a very good experience and I would like to stay there again. Though honestly had i not got the offer, I would have considered the rates (4700 / day) high and opted out.\n": "Positive",
                    "\nI chose to stay as this was one of the RCI Gold Crown resort. I did not have great expectations. However surprisingly it provided overall very good experience. Location was good and maintained.I got spacious room with big balcony with wonderful valley view. Food and dining hospitality was good; thanks to Hemant - restaurant in charge. He was personally taking care of all clients. I liked it. Other amenities were OK and staff need to improve a bit. Stay could be better if had additional information about all activities and facilities provided. Overall, we enjoyed our stay.\n": "Neutral",
                    "\nI had booked 2 studio rooms at Sterling White Mist Manali for 5 nights during Oct 2013 through RCI. The resort's location, upkeep, food, service and staff is excellent. I have stayed at many other hotels and resorts in the past but did not find such a great staff anywhere. The service is almost instant and you will find someone caring for you everywhere in the resort. The food is very nice and the restaurant staff is again ready for anything you ask for. They never say NO to anything. Overall it was one of the best experiences of life. I will recommend this property to anyone planning to stay in Manali. If you have your own vehicle to roam around, all the more suitable. If the resort can setup a lift in the new block also, will add lot of convenience to the old age visitors.\n": "Positive",
                    "\nI had booked this place through RCI. And I'm repenting my decision to visit this hotel. This hotel is very big but is look like budgeted hotel. I had visited this place with my family includes my 3 yr old daughter. This hotel look good from exterior but interiors are pathetic. Floor was broken, tiles was broken, no light in hall except one small bulb. (can you imagine I spend one night). Poor heating facility (I had given brandy to my family). Room's were stinking. Geyser was pathetic. Bathroom look like Hospital. And I had paid astronomical high price to book this hotel when it was available at as low as 1700 rs. per day.

RCI connected to hotel. Mean time I had booked another hotel and left the hotel. That time Hotel Manager Mr. Rajesh meet me and promise me better room and service. And they actually done really well. In this hotel few room are in better condition. (still avoid it). I had plan for 7 days. out of that 2 days I was Screwed very badly. Next 3 days things was much better.

The room allotted to us had hint of cigarette smell , which was informed to person showing the room . He bluntly refused that there was nothing of such sort and smoking is not permitted in the room. After some argument they agreed to change the room. The staff at the restaurant was also not upto mark I think it was supposedly a gold crown resort , but off late because of the renovation work in the resort the ratings have gone down No wifi internet .

                    "\nI stayed at White Mist, Manali for 5 days. Hotel is far from the city. The views are not that great as you would find in whole of Manali. You would need to hire a taxi every time at an inflated price to go to the city. If you hire any taxi to go places like Solang Valley, Manikaran, they would charge you higher as they have to pick you up from a far off place. You cannot take a walk in the evening outside as it is an isolated place and not safe at all. Food too is okay. I like hill station food and eating at different places, but you have no option for dinner than to eat at the hotel itself. Rooms are not great either. they are small with not so great bedding as you would expect from a hotel of such rating. I would not recommend White Mist if you are planning to visit Manali. Book a hotel which is accessible with good views.\n": "Negative",

                    "\nI stayed in a suite here for 2 nights and found the accommodation to be good. The service is good too and so is the food. The suite is large with a sit-out and has views of snow-clad mountains albeit distant and not that great. But location wise there are better placed hotels in Manali, that provide better views and are closer to the city centre. This one is a bit far-off and the approach road has been severely damaged recently. There's no Wi-Fi but there is an Internet cafe which charges Rs 60 for half an hour of surfing which seems expensive! The food too is very expensive, for instance a humble sada dosa costs Rs 165 before taxes! Overall I found the accommodation and service to be good, but if you really want to enjoy Manali choose a scenic locale or a hotel in close proximity to the mall road depending on what you like. This one unfortunately scores low on both these fronts. Also considering that the suite costs Rs 4000 per night before discounts, it might be a tad expensive, and am not aware of the condition of other rooms! They have other facilities like spa, fitness center etc but I didn't try them, who needs them after all with all there is to see and do in Manali. But I did get a call informing me about these facilities on the first day of my stay and these seemed expensive too!\n": "Neutral",

Particularly, remarkable praise to Mr Hemant Das (Manager) who couldn\u2019t have been any more helpful and friendly. Surprised at his quality and professionalism, he actually impressed with the level and quality of service. Even though the Hotel was full and extremely busy, he managed all with his ever smile face.

Their wash rooms had no dental kit or comb etc, even when asking for basic stuff like these, got different response from different staff members, one said they don't have any, another said they don't give it to sterling customers, while another said they are given only to select sterling customers based on which package they have taken. Even talking to resort manager didn't help. It was not about the basic stuff, but how you treat your guests. BTW, we had the top paid package from sterling and have got all these basic stuff in their other resorts before.

The staff who was kept for the game was wonderful.Over all very good hotel for every one.\n": "Positive",
                    "\nI travelled to Manali from 2nd - 5th Jan to celebrate new year with friends and family.We have chosen White Mist-Sterling resorts from make my trip.Since the deal was good so we thought to opt the same.By the time we reached manali we have call the service desk to ask whether they provide can for the hotel which they clearly denied.We took a private cab from bus stand to the hotel which is placed around 5kms from it.After Reaching hotel we requested to see the room but we they ask to wait for 30mins since the room was not clean.By the time we wish to see the hotel and there we came to know that the hotel was quite different as shown in the pictures.Certain cons which i would like to highlight:-1. The hotel as mentioned on sited is not on mall road but far away from it around 5kms.2.Transportation costs around 200rs per side if you wish to mall road or nearby.3,Hotel mentions 80 rooms but have only 33rooms instead.4.There is no facility of Wi-fi as mentioned on websites.5.The staff was not at all helpful in sorting out your queries.6.No generator facility at the night in case of breakdown.7.It seems to be more than a 3star hotel rather than a resort.8.No good restaurants nearby.only option is to have it in hotel only.9.They don't even provide a knife to cut fruits or rather you can say they don't even pay courtesy even to facilitate you. 10.Room cleaning can be done only once and that too as per not your convenience but the time they felt like.Overall a disappointing hotel with a scarcity of many facilities.\n": "Negative",

However, where sterling scores is over its location, a few kms aways from manali town, at a place called prini, on the manali-naggar highway. The resort is well-planned out with spacious wating area, a nice restaurant and a reasonable well-stocked activity room. The rooms are adequate with stunning views from some of them. The food selection provided in the restaurant was of a good variety, but the quality fluctuated a bit (taste-wise), probably because the chef was a new recruit (just had been employed 10 days previously, we learnt). The prices of the dish were extremely reasonable. The travel desk facilities, were very good, as we expect in Sterling Resorts. The location of the resort ensured that you could easily make day trips to Naggar, Solang valley, Rohtang pass, Vashisht or simply laze about the premises with the good book (borrowed from their library at a nominal cost) or play with your kids from an array of games available in the activity center - badminton, table tennis, carrom, cards, pool, etc.\n": "Positive",

There are shops in the vicinity for basic needs and the property is adjacent to Holiday inn.Cons: Room - Post check-in there were hairs on the bed, upon complaint sheets was changed. I was given room towards the road side so sleep quality wasn't good enough. The washroom needs renovation since its a decade old style. Handwash and shower gel was provided. Insufficient charging facility was available in room. The cable network was not working well so all those who wish to watch television for a while might be disappointed. Hot water facility was unavailable during day, however, they were willing to give water in the bucket from outside.Food: Buffet could have been better, all those who like parathas might be disappointed with raw ones. Options of buffet could have been more. Table cloth was dirty in the restaurant. Breakfast starts 7.30 am but in our case it wasn't completely ready upto 8 am. Food menu overpriced as compared to other better hotels in the town. The staff in the restaurant could have been more courteous, soft spoken, willing to serve food even at the time of breakfast. If you order ice cubes in the room then its chargeable. Lift/ Elevator: Wasn't working at the time of cheek-in however from evening started working.Location: Its approx 5 kms from the mall road, one has to wait for sometime at the road for passing by auto rickshaws and taxis fare of which is expensive during season 100 to 400 depends upon your bargain. Travel Desk: The concerned person was not available at the travel desk so a lady (sitting at travel desk) guided us, however, she didn't guide us properly despite apparently knowing everything since we told that we won't be staying for long in the hotel. Exaggerated claim to be a part of esteemed sterling holidays. Very disappointed. I hope management listens !!\n": "Neutral",

Cons : The hotel is in the Prini area which is far away from the main manali area.  No local transportation to the main manali area available.  So u vl actually need ur own car or the hotel car for transportation.  There was no activity area and no wifi in the hotel. Reason for the same was  that the hotel was just renovated.  Also during our stay, the lift was not working for two full days. When we and some other customers complained, they said that engineers are working over it and that the same will be in working condition in and hour. Bt till we left the hotel, the same was not working. We had to climb up and down 3 floors everytime. There were also elderly aged people in the hotel who also had to face this lift issues.

The dining facilities are wholesome with buffets for breakfast, lunch and dinner and are available as an added package. View of the Himalayas from the dining room is to kill for. Service at times was sluggish but with a little nudging got better. Lots of games and activities for children as well as family if you want some leisure and the travel desk is most helpful if you want to venture out.

Food is also quite nice and plenty of varieties. Well is this the positive side. Only one negative part is the quality of facility. Some places the wooden floor is broken, heater was not working and toilet is not clean either. We enjoyed our stay and had a great trip with sterling.

And it is a nice place; however a lot needs to be improved, really. We reached the resort around 9 in the night as it was snowing and driving was a bit difficult. There weren\u2019t many boards giving directions on how to reach the resort. Upon reaching the place we found out there was no valet parking available. The porch was not really big enough to keep the snow away. There were no door mats to keep the dirt and muck away from the reception / lobby area.On checking in we saw both the rooms were done differently. Beds, mattresses, etc. all were different. The rooms were facing the lobby which was facing outside world. Snow and water from above was all dripping in the lobby area. As a result we had dirt marks all across the room. Also during the night snow used to slide from the room and parts of it used to hit our room door wetting whole place. On top of all this the heaters provided in the rooms were not efficient enough. There was no provision of connecting another heater. Hot water was available in the morning from 7-10 and in the evening from 4-6 and not 24 hours.The room service was good.

                    "\nThe 3 star Sterling resorts in Manali, very old built, frankly could not live up to my expectations. We were 2 couples. I advice you to take journey thru Volvo nt car ,as the total journey was tedious.Very first thing that amused me in hotel was there was no Valet Parking. Although the hotel looked good from the outside, it did not have a lift, neither were the rooms all that good. The last thing you would want after a tiring journey, is smelling bathrooms. The bathrooms seriously need some furnishing. One thing very good though were the views.Take left side rooms with a view to mountains not valley.And there are some parking facing rooms, avoid them.There was no lift in the hotel, so try keep your booking to 1st floor only. Hot water was available in the morning from 7-10 and in the evening from 4-6 and not 24 hours. The quality of the room is not worth the money you pay. Old wardrobe's and bad bathrooms perhaps attributed to it. Facilities were decent with a small kitchen inside the room, which makes it worth while for families with small children as the same will be useful making milk, tea, home food etc. We happened to visit the spa and it was nice. Very nice clean and well kept. Good playing activities. The resort has good playing activities, somethings children would definitely enjoy.We did Water-Rafting too in Kulu, which is 1 hour drive from the Resort. Dont go for outside activities co-ordinated by hotel staff- They have their margins.There was only 1 restaurant but was quite good. Nice breakfasts and food.It is a decent family resort with facilities suiting them. But if you are a couple, or a bunch of college friends you can perhaps find better places. Surely the resort does not live up to it's brand Sterling's name. It's perhaps one of their not so good one's. Not worth the money for my liking.The only silver lining of the whole package was the cheap rates provided by our tour operator.We booked on internet from Antilog Vacations which r very budget & the best for manali tours.They suggested us that Apple country resort was a better option but we somehow stuck to this hotel.Anyways , we r contented that we got cheaper rates than the fellow travellers\n": "Neutral",
                    "\nThe Resort has two building with lot of play area for children and activity area. main building is having very traditional look and the other one look like apartment building.The location of the hotel is 3 kilometers away from main city and markets even though very good since it is located between mountains on both the sides. The view from this hotel is very panoramic and quite view worthy. We had our room with balcony over the play ground. we had direct view of mountains from our balcony. We got snow very next day when we reached at Manali, our room was warm to stay in comfortably. The room we had was spacious enough to accommodate four of us. The room service was quick and on the dot. The Breakfast was excellent which compromised the lunch and diner quality. The service was very polite and social. The hotel staff was very courteous and ready to help at any length also they have all types of arrangements for every need of their customers. We had gone to Manali for first time and we were not having any idea what places we visit? The courtesy shown by the hotel reception and Manager and guided us with all details of places to visit with total arrangements. The hotel also have various food plans rates, to suit your budget and taste.Cost wise the hotel is in medium group providing some where 3 star facility, but the hotel is maintained very well. In the indoor activity area they have lovey games so one can not feel bored. The Sterling Resort where we stayed for 7 days is definitely we recommend to our friend and is the place to keep visiting again and again.Thank you very much to The Sterling resort to give us a memorable leisure time.\n": "Positive",
                    "\nThe best part of this hotel was when we opened the window curtains early morning. A breathtaking view of the himalayas stole our gaze. That was all i needed for my moneys worth!! There is a well maintained nice lawn, it helped us soak some sun when it was too cold. They have some recreation too like table tennis and all that.

                    "\nThis being my third visit to White Mist Manali, explains a lot about the resort. Standing up to Sterling hospitality this resort leaves no stone unturned to make to make your stay a memorable one. Even though, this time around, the main building was undergoing renovations, you would never realize that until you walked to the parking which presently doubled up as a debris collection ground, but without compromising on the parking.facility. The staff is friendly and courteous, the check in quite swift. The rooms are good, I visited this resort after 13 years this time and should admit that the decor has kept up with the times. The sheets and towels are impeccably spotless, the toilets clean and smelling good. The restaurant, presently a make-shift arrangement due to the renovations was decent and the choice of food is varied, right from South Indian to Continental to Local, its all available. The holiday activities room is equipped with games (though I think they were lesser as compared to my last visit) With all the positives in it favour, Sterling Resorts have changed their full-fledged kitchens in to dry kitchens in the rooms (a few plates, cutlery, bowls, a microwave oven, a coffee heating pot, etc.). The very reason one prefers Sterling was the facility of having a fully-equipped kitchen so you could have home food even in a distant land (you just cant eat out every day). This is the probable cause for my kids to getting a stomach infection and still we didn't have a choice (though not because of their restaurant, but again you cant keep eating in their restaurant too), with fever temperature reaching 103 we called the front desk if any medical help could be obtained, the support offered was inadequate (a doctor on call would charge Rs. 1500) and the nearest hospital was a Mission hospital at Mall Road.Luckily the medications we were carrying helped and the kids were fine the next day. Overall the experience was a nice one, but hey this could've been expected from any good hotel, WHY CHOOSE STERLING THEN?\n": "Positive",

From the room you can enjoy the mountains with white snow background and for nature lovers this is a treat to watch . The restuarant is very good and serve excellent food. Winter time is worth visiting as you can see the snow laden mountains and scenic beauty . It is a treat to go out and enjoy . But if the snow is very heavy you get struck indoors . Also there is problem of flights getting cancelled or rescheduled. All these are worth the risk for the enjoyment you get.\n": "Positive",

                    "\nThis is not one of Sterling Hotels better properties in India. It is on the wrong side of the Beas river, the main attraction of the hill station. You hear the constant roar of the gorgeous river but have to travel a couple of Kms through dreadful roads and rickety bridges before you get to the river front. The staff as with all Sterling hotels is most courteous , they do their best to please. The food is good though the buffet could do with greater variety. We were there during 'off tourist ' season when the hotel tends to let out rooms on big discount to groups, this makes for a noisy and crowded environment. But Manali is superb , still one of the better hill stations and one does not mind the little let downs.\n": "Neutral",

They guided us very well to various sight seeing places, and went out of the way to arrange a trip for us to Rohtang. Cons: The place is located quite far from the main market, and it was difficult to find. Tough we had our own vehicle so the distance was not an issue, but other wise finding transport to and fro the market area migh be difficult.\n": "Positive",

There are two blocks , one which is the hotel in which the non Sterling members stay where we did and the other block which is more like the service apartment which has an adjoining kitchen is mostly given to the Sterling Members. I would insist that you request the hotel for a Mountain view room from where the sunrise view is quite spectacular. The food of the restaurant's hotel is quite good especially the Mughlai food. Service of the hotel was also good as expected by Sterling resorts. For looking around in Manali, the travel desk at the basement will help for the travel plans and vehicle arrangements. We managed to stay in October , 2013 and that was a good time to see Manali as after some time Rohtang Paas was shut down due to bad weather conditions up there, also being a off time for manali , you will find the place less crowded.In all a great hotel with a very affordable price tag.\n": "Positive",

Lobby and restaurant area was good but rooms were furnished with old upholstery and particularly bathroom needs immediate renovation as it spoil the image of this hotel.

We were staying at a duplex unit, well furnished, with a lovely balcony, small kitchenette, with microwave and toaster etc. The facilities for the kitchenette were not exactly fantastic but was just adequate for the two of us. The service was superb, every one at the resort was extremely friendly. We also ate a few times at the restaurant - the food was good and very cheap, especially with the usual RCI discounts! We did not use any other facilities. The only two problems were the innumerable steps we had negotiate every time we went out and also the almost inadequate heating facilities. Although there were two room heaters (Bajaj) but they hardly emitted any warm (leave alone hot!) air and were merely like decorations! Fortunately we had carried a VERY GOOD Philips room heater as well as an electric under-blanket - both of which came in extremely handy in the super cold temperatures. We were there in mid-December with temperatures plunging to minus figures at nights. Although the resort told us they only supply hot water during some hours in the mornings and evenings - we always got enough water whenever we opened the taps!!! Which was very useful! I suppose their insulations are good! Over all we had a really nice time there! Hope to get back again sometime.\n": "Positive",
                    "\nWe stayed at the White Mist for three nights. The Hotel was basically a bed and breakfast as it was still undergoing renovation and really did not have much to offer. The most surprising aspect was that there was no wifi at the Hotel even though the rest of the world had basic internet connectivity including the Club Mahindra next door. The other interesting thing is that in this particular resort you had to ask for everything as no information is shared including tours that the Resort can apparently arrange on our behalf.The only consolation is that the renovation is being correctly done as the rooms were really great with a wonderful view and there was no construction noise. The food served in the Restaurant was good and there are large TVs strategically placed where we could see the India - South Africa match over dinner.On the whole, I would say that the family had a relaxing trip however we would have loved to see a true 4 Star experience where the Resort staff would go out of their way to make the experience a truly memorable one.\n": "Negative",

Hotel is established in slightly lesser area but the location is superb. Amazing Manali was seen from here. Full of snow n white was never so beautiful.

Little extras like the nightly turndown service, take out menus the one night we wanted to order, bottled water, and the overall friendliness of the staff makes you feel very special. They will go out of their way to make sure your stay is beyond perfect. You will not be disappointed. Trust me, I would like to give special recognition to the Hotel Manager Hemant Das who was simply wonderful toward us. He was most helpful in answering or numerous questions and always offered a kind smile. We felt very homely being called by our names every time we walked in and out and at the restaurant was the perfect touch, and the manager will make sure you are taken care of.

Rooms are equipped with all the facilities which are of benefit.View from the rooms is quite good. Hotel also arranges for outdoor activities. Rates are quite affordable for the outdoor activities. Hotel also arranges for indoor activities to keep the guests entertained and busy. Only problem with this hotel is that location is a little away from the main market. But if you have a taxi(which we had) then its not a hassle. Overall it was a pleasant experience.\n": "Positive",
                    "\nWe stayed in this hotel when we visited Manali.It is an excellent hotel... Great back view of mountains... Clean and Nice rooms.Lttle bit conjucted.Staff were good, Friendly, Supportive and fast in service,Bathroom were clean.Want to suggest this hotel to other members and tourists as well.\n": "Positive",
                    "\nWe stayed in this resort for 3 nights. We took 3 rooms for my family. .It was a great vacation and we are really happy with the resort services but still I would like to recommend a few upgrades. 1st is surely like many have already said that the washrooms need major renovation. .flooring was cracked and shabby..room heating was inadequate.hot Water was available for limited time only. But it doesn't mean that they don't have positives..the resort was big and beautiful, so were the rooms with many facilities including kitchen utensils with microwave also. .which was very useful as we were travelling with kids.buffet was not available due to shortage of guests but every thing we required from ala carte were provided without any charges. However I would recommend this resort and would also visit again personally. .\n": "Positive",
                    "\nWe three couples stayed there for three days and two nights. The place was wonderful and we traveled by vehicle from Delhi. I advice you to break journey as the total journey was tedious( if you are visiting in summer). The rooms ware neat and the bed was excellent. View from the main building was excellent. We really had a enjoyable trip.\n": "Positive",
                    "\nWe travelled to Manali during the second week of March' 11 and stayed at Sterling Resorts for four nights. The hotel located at Phirni Rd, is at a fair distance from Mall Road, which lends it a serenity and calm, that you are trying to escape from the more commercial locations. Also, the duplex suite that we were in had a lovely view of the snow capped peaks. The service was excellent, and everybody in the staff was ever ready to help with a smile. The hotel desk also had a number of activities in late evenings that we enjoyed. My only grouse with the hotel is the lack of central heating. The hotel provided two portbale room heaters, but they were not good enough for the chilly nights we experienced during the stay.\n": "Positive",
                    "\nWe visited during December 2014. Part of the resort was under renovation which is badly needed to the resort. The resort is old and even the other half badly needs renovation. There is no parking for the cars. It's a bit away from mall road and one need to have a car along. Food and staff are really nice and hospitable. The resort has very good view indeed. I hope post renovation, the resort would be the most visited in manali.\n": "Neutral",
                    "\nWe visited the resort in the third week of June, 2013. The resort is located about 3 kms away from the main city in the village of Prini. Many fellow travelers have complained that the location of the property isn't very good but that is no true. If you wish to stay in a resort, you have to stay a bit away from the main town. Even more expensive resorts like the Holiday Inn, Club Mahindra and the Honeymoon Inn are located in close vicinity. Only Manali Resorts is located at a better place while others like the Span are located even further out. The staff is very friendly and courteous. During our 5 day long stay, we were treated really well. The rooms are clean and spacious but seem to be in need of some modern flair. As we stayed in a Studio apartment, we also had a microwave and an electric kettle at our disposal. The food from the in-house restaurant is extremely good. They have a wide variety of items and the taste is fantastic. They hold activities in the evening and the incharge knows how to give people a good time. The game room too is very good as you can play games like Air Hockey, Table Tennis, Carrom, Snakes and Ladders. For the younger amongst us, consoles like Nintendo Wii and PS2 are available for hire.All in all, the experience was pretty good.\n": "Positive",
                    "\nWe went for a family vacation to Manali in June 2013 for 4 days. Happened to book this hotel based on Tripadvisor reviews. Nice ambiance, neat and clean, nice view of snow peaks n Manali town from the room balcony, very good hospitality and service. Food was also pretty good except that South Indian dishes could be improved. They even packed for us breakfast n lunch as early as 4.00 am when we had to leave for Rohtang pass. Campfire n lively fun activities organized in the evening were refreshing ones to mention. Rooms could be revamped to meet modern standards, for example there were not many plug points for charging gadgets and no wi-fi. But, overall it was a very good holiday experience.\n": "Positive",
                    "\nWe were a group of 15 people and the stay was extremely comfortable!We were there for about a week.The staff was very helpful and courteous,arranged for cars at the last moment late night till chandigarh since our flight from manali was cancelled and we had connecting flights.Buffet spread of breakfast,lunch and dinner was amazing,even made us anything special we asked for.Food was tasty!We stayed in duplex rooms and they were great.The view from the balcony was beautiful,could see snow capped peaks!!!The rooms even had kitchen space and utensils.If you are travelling in a big group and wish to stay in the hotel and not go for sight seeing they would arrange for games and bonfire on request...THE OVERALL EXPERIENCE WAS AMAZING AND WE THOROUGHLY ENJOYED THE STAY... Best property to stay in Manali..!!!\n": "Positive",
                    "\nWe zeroed on Sterling Resorts under the lifetime membership offer. And in that offer the costs were nearly 20% of the original. The Room was spacious but basic. Though it offered a good view of the snow covered mountains. The Food whether it be Punjabi or South Indian, breakfast and juices were amazing. The resort did try and provide for campfire etc but we wanted to relax and thus didn't opt for them. Tried our hands at table tennis and carrom a bit. They arranged for all the site visits and our drop to Kullu (obviously charged).\n": "Neutral",
                    "\nWe, 3 couples visited Manali Sterling, alongwith 2 kids in July, 2011.. To my surprise, the compact rooms, we were alloted were totally refurnished.. We had a good tome at the Resort for 7 days.. he service was good and the staff was helpful. One day we did a Bar-Be-Que in the Resort lawns and we were charged exorbitantly by the Resort for the Equipment, we hired from them.. We had taken our own cook with us, although and he prepared all the Bar-Be-Que..Taking a cook alongwith us, turned out to be economical and food was prepared to our taste.. Eating outside, everday, makes you sick, although, we tried many eating joints, like Johnsons Cafe ( Good food ), Johnsons Bar, next door and partyed their till wee hours in the morning.. I would suggest to try out Belavista resort for authentic Pizza and The Dirty Dog eatery on the river in old Manali.Oh the whole, our trip was wonderful.. Take your own conveyance, id you want to see Manali, extensively. We did Water-Rafting too in Kulu, which is 1 hour drive from the Resort..\n": "Positive",
                    "\nWell, It may have happened because I visited in the off season but the experience in this expensive resort was not pleasant at all. There was no facilities available for guests nor the usual features available in a resort. Plus half the area was under maintenance. Further, most of the answers were given a negative reply. Add to it the indifferent attitude of the reception and support staff. For the price it charges, it is a strict thumbs down for the hotel.Visited 25th-28th September 2015.\n": "Negative",
                    "\nWent to Diwali vacation in Manali seeing the rating I decided to go Sterling Resort with my wife and 3 yr old daughter. I reached Manali in evening around 7 pm on 26.10.2011 given a grand welcome as if I and my family mean to them everything. They had made special arrangements to give us the best Diwali day celebration brusting crackers, live counter of food to prepare as we want. I was feeling like home.My room 2012 was having the best veiw with all the amenties. I was been given a choice to choose a package for the buffet. Which was amasing and effortable. Nishant who is working there is a nice person my daughter got attached with him and was playing with him alone. Nishant I would never forget your hospitality. Also he cried so did my wife and daughter. Also all the staff member even the Bartender, Managers also. Chef was very nice he always use to take the suggestions and implement it. Over all it was by best vacation ever. I would never ever forget.\n": "Positive",
                    "\nWent to Manali in Dec End, It was a great pleasure staying in this hotel, Nice property, big rooms, good staff. The only this which is related to the location of this property, This is bit far away from the Market.\n": "Positive",
                    "\nZero management, clueless staff; lack of cordination. A so called resort with no management or leadership to direct.We were not provided with the junior suite that we booked as property was under renovation; were provided with a studio room in another block; upon being asked for the tariff; they only replied that this is best. Very basic room like a government rest house. No activity and least options in kids play area (a small room) with only ludo, chess and carrom as options. Air hockey table and video game on payable basis but these too were out of order. Couple of cycles were available for kids but for that charges were 150 Rs for 1 hour. Being an old property they hardly have any space and are misfit to be called as a resort.We requested front office incharge many times to lodge our protest and for feedback; surprisingly the resort manager or GM never came in front to counsel or take ownership of lapses.In bone chilling winter; hot water is available only from 7-10AM in morning and 7-9 PM in evening; during other times they will deliver a bucket; Our room had a heat convector but it was just a simple fan blower ;We were told that the electricity load in the day is low hence it wont work well but after 10 PM in night it will work well. Naggar area of Manali where this resort is located has much better options; hence it is advised that do explore those too.Sterling Ooty-Fern Hill is far better and a true resort but at Manali it seems the management has least interest to operate; the morale of staff and team looked very down and they were all helpless whenever we reported issues.\n": "Negative",
                    "\ni stayed at the white mist resort for three days. the place is very beautiful, just opposite the snow clad hills. nice ambience and scenario. the place is a bit far from the bus stand and mall road, but it has plenty of cars and taxis. so no worry. the staff is competent and sincere.\n": "Positive",

                    "\ni took my family to Sterling White Mist, Manali in the last week of April, 2012 being the childrens' summer holidays. We drove down from Delhi. The road from Kulu to Manali is really bad and was under construction. The stay at Sterling was pretty good. We got a duplex room facing the valley with a bed above the staircase and a double bed below. The resort is pretty well maintained and there is also an option to preserve the bed sheet for an extra day without cleaning in order to save water and contributing to the environment. You just need to put a pamphlet at the bedside onto the bed while leaving for this. The food is also OK and you get a good deal by booking a two meal for your family in the morning. There are indoor games avaiable and the resort is located close to the town centre.There is also a spa where one can get a good massage done in traditional Kerala ayurvedic style. The masseurs are also experienced in the trade.The resort also organises outdoor trips for snow sleds, paragliding and cable car riding besides trips to Kulu for Shawls, trips to Rohtang pass which is the highest motorable road etc. We enjoyed our trip thoroughly but I would suggest a traveller to go there during end of winter rather.\n": "Positive",

We checked-in at around 5 in the morning and does not had any problem getting the room. The receptionist(poor guy got up in middle of sleep does not know about our arrival) welcomed us and provided the room within no time.(The only disappointment is they charged 1000 bucks for early check-in, can be ignored for their service). The rooms were very spacious, clean and linens were fresh. As soon as we entered the room we jumped on to the bed and had a nice sleep(since we had a terrific journey last night from Shimla). Woke up at 9:30 and were hungry like mad. We had breakfast in the room only. We ordered Parathas, Poori bhaji, toast. The food was exceptionally good. I did not have this kind of food any where else in such type of properties. The taste of the food was awesome. The chef there deserves an EXCELLENT rating. For the rest of our stay we had food in the resort itself.The staff there were very friendly and helpful. I highly recommend this place for any kind of travellers.

All chargeable games and other activities should be free for the members.2.
